# File Based (Linear) Search : slow 
# Double Array Based (Linear) Search : okay but slow with large files
# Chromosome Indexed (Linear) Search : hash structure; works much better with using chr as key and all the chr's features in an array as value
# Chromosome Indexed Location Hashing : like chr indexed, and add on location hashing (slices of the chr)
 

# An interesting topic would be to look at this in different languages. Right now, it's in Perl. Can also write in C, Python, and more.
# Why Perl? 
++ Using hashes in Perl makes working with biological data such as Browser Extensible Data (BED) files an easy task. 
++ Perl is usually the go-to language for me. It's good to write scripts in and work with bioinformatics data. That's the main reason I wrote these in Perl first.  
++ It's not a highly mathematical and computational intensive project. It also doesn't require objects. 
++ I think C would be another great language to try out these programs in, and would probably be a little bit faster.
